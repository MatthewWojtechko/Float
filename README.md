Float was created by Matthew Wojtechko and John-Paul Depew. All rights reserved.

Float was developed in 5 weeks for an advanced game development class by my classmate John-Paul Depew and I.
We had each previously worked on intense sci-fi games and wanted a change of pace by working on a game at the opposite end of the spectrum.
The goal was to create a game that would be uplifting and meditative, appealing to casual audiences who wanted to relax.
We knew that core aspects of meditative experience include a growing sense of wholness, feeling like part of something bigger, and transcending the limitations of everyday life - all in a quiet, peaceful way.
A balloon lazily floating through a park, growing into a bigger bundle by finding lost balloons and lifting into the air, we realized, was an evocative metaphor for meditation.
John-Paul worked on the core mechanics, while I found the 3D models and crafted the scenery.
After this, I worked on other features like soothing hint mechanics, the tranquil start menu, and the uplifting climax after the second level.
